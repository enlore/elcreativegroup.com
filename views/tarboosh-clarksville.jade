        | We were tasked with creating an easily navigable
        | menu for Tarboosh's delivery customers, so we tapped a mutual
        | friend and professional photographer, Lester Black, to shoot up the
        | food.

        | We collaborated with the restaurant's owner, Fatah Manface,
        | to deside on a look and feel for the site that represents the
        | atmosphere at his restaurant.
