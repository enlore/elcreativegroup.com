            We were tasked with creating an easily navigable
            menu for Tarboosh's delivery customers, so we tapped a mutual
            friend and professional photographer, Lester Black, to shoot up the
            food.

            We collaborated with the restaurant's owner, Fatah Hantouli,
            to deside on a look and feel for the site that represents the
            atmosphere at his restaurant.

            Of course, with mobile traffic eclipsing desktop, the site had
            to be responsive so busy business people and college kids could
            check out Tarboosh's offerings on the go with their phones.
